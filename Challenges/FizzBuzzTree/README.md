# FizzBuzz
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

## Challenge
Create a class caWrite a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with it’s news values.

C# directions: Instead of changing the values of the nodes, output to the console the new values respectively.

## Efficiency
Time: O(n), each node in the tree is traversed
Space: O(h), the method is recursive and spans the height of the tree
