# Insert and shift middle index of array
Write a method called ArrayShift() which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge
Given an array of integers and a single integer, insert the single integer in the middle of the array.

## Solution
Ex1
input -->[2,4,6,8], 5	
output --> [2,4,5,6,8]

Ex2
input -->[4,8,15,23,42], 16	
output --> [4,8,15,16,23,42]
