# Queue with Stacks
 Implement a Queue using two Stacks.
 
 ## Challenge
Create a new Queue class. Using only two Stack instances, implement this Queue with the following methods:

  + enqueue(value) which inserts value into the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
  + dequeue() which extracts a value from the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.

The Stack instances have only push and pop methods, and a size property (size property is optional). Instantiate these Stack objects in your Queue constructor.
