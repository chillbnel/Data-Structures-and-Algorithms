# Data Structures and Algorithms
These are a series of whiteboard challenges completed during Code Fellow's Advanced Software Development in ASP.NET Core. Each week we were given a data structure and then throughout the week, tasked to develop algorithmic solutions to corresponding data structure problems. Solutions include: the problem statement, problem visualization, time/space reqirements (Big O notation), algorithm, peusdo code, code (C# written using the Visual Studio IDE), and testing requirements.

NOTE: Challenges 1-3 were completed in teams of three, while the remainder were completed in teams of two. All work captured in the whiteboard images were completed in 30 min or less.
