# Data Structures and Algorithms
These are a series of whiteboard challenges completed during Code Fellow's Advanced Software Development in ASP.NET Core. Challenges 1-3 were completed in teams of three, challenges 4-6 were completed in teams of two and the remainder were completed indiviually. All work captured in the whiteboard images were completed in 30 min or less.  We then coded the solution in C# to reinforce our fundementals.
