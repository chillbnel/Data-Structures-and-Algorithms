# Trees

## Description/Implementation
Tree traversals fall into two catagories: depth first, breadth first. Depth first can traverse the tree via pre-order(root, left, right), in-order (left, root, right), or post-order (left, right, root).

A binary seach can also be used to locate a specific value; In a binary search tree, the tree is organized in a manner where all numbers that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all numbers that are larger than the root are placed to the right.  The searched value is then compared against the root.  Big O, S: O(1), T: O(log n)
