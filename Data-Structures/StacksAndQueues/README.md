# Stacks and Queues

## Description/Implementation

Stack: A collection of objects that when built utilizes a last-in/first-out approach. The Push method is used to place an object at the top of the stack, the Pop method removes and returns the top object in the queue,  and the Peek method is used to return (without removing) the top object in the stack. 

Queue: A collection of objects that when built utilizes a first-in/first-out approach.  The Enqueue method is used to add an object to the queue, the Dequeue method removes and returns the next object in the queue, and the Peek method is used to return (without removing) the next object in the queue.
